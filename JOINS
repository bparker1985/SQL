-- This will be covering INNER JOIN, FULL, LEFT, RIGHT OUTER JOIN
-- A JOIN is a way to combine mutliple tables into a single output
-- A JOIN needs to have a common column or key, it should be a unique field

SELECT *
FROM EmployeeDemographics

SELECT *
FROM EmployeeSalary

SELECT *
FROM EmployeeDemographics AS EmpDem
INNER JOIN EmployeeSalary AS EmpSal
ON EmpDem.EmployeeID = EmpSal. EmployeeID
-- The INNER JOIN shows everything that is common in table A (EmpDem) and Table B (EmpSal)

SELECT *
FROM EmployeeDemographics AS EmpDem
FULL OUTER JOIN EmployeeSalary AS EmpSal
ON EmpDem.EmployeeID = EmpSal. EmployeeID
-- A FULL OUTER JOIN shows everything that is both tables, even it doesn't match or has NULL values

SELECT *
FROM EmployeeDemographics AS EmpDem
LEFT OUTER JOIN EmployeeSalary AS EmpSal
ON EmpDem.EmployeeID = EmpSal. EmployeeID
-- The LEFT OUTER JOIN shows everything in Table A (EmpDem) and only records that match in Table B (EmpSal)

SELECT *
FROM EmployeeDemographics AS EmpDem
RIGHT OUTER JOIN EmployeeSalary AS EmpSal
ON EmpDem.EmployeeID = EmpSal. EmployeeID
-- The RIGHT OUTER JOIN shows everything in Table B (EmpSal) and only records that match in Table A (EmpDem)

SELECT EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName, JobTitle, Salary
FROM EmployeeDemographics AS EmpDem
INNER JOIN EmployeeSalary AS EmpSal
ON EmpDem.EmployeeID = EmpSal. EmployeeID
-- This returns an error becasue the EmployeeID is in both tables and it needs to be specified which want I want to be returned

SELECT EmpDem.EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName, JobTitle, Salary
FROM EmployeeDemographics AS EmpDem
INNER JOIN EmployeeSalary AS EmpSal
ON EmpDem.EmployeeID = EmpSal. EmployeeID
-- It runs now, becasue I specified the table and also, it shows another example of how useful alising tables is

SELECT JobTitle, Salary
FROM EmployeeDemographics AS EmpDem
INNER JOIN EmployeeSalary AS EmpSal
ON EmpDem.EmployeeID = EmpSal. EmployeeID
WHERE JobTitle = 'Trainer'
-- This is anexample of how to query specific information using a JOIN

SELECT JobTitle, AVG(Salary) AS AVGSalary
FROM EmployeeDemographics AS EmpDem
INNER JOIN EmployeeSalary AS EmpSal
ON EmpDem.EmployeeID = EmpSal. EmployeeID
WHERE JobTitle = 'Trainer'
GROUP BY JobTitle
-- This is anexample of how to query specific information using a JOIN and an aggregate function
